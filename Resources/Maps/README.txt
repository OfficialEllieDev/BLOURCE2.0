HOW TO CREATE CUSTOM MAPS:

1. Create a first folder with the name of your map

2. Create 3 other folders (as of BLOURCE 0.9) respectively called "Info", "Entities", and "Other"

3. Create a new ModuleScript inside of your Info folder called "Level_Script" (was "ScriptedSequencing" as of BLOURCE 0.9)
